This page provide hints on distributing Nim using OS packages.

See \href{distros.html}{distros} for tools to detect Linux distribution
at runtime.

Nim runs on a wide variety of platforms. Support on amd64 and i386 is
tested regularly, while less popular platforms are tested by the
community.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  amd64
\item
  arm64 (aka aarch64)
\item
  armel
\item
  armhf
\item
  i386
\item
  m68k
\item
  mips64el
\item
  mipsel
\item
  powerpc
\item
  ppc64
\item
  ppc64el (aka ppc64le)
\item
  riscv64
\end{itemize}

The following platforms are seldomly tested:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  alpha
\item
  hppa
\item
  ia64
\item
  mips
\item
  s390x
\item
  sparc64
\end{itemize}

See \url{https://github.com/nim-lang/Nim/labels/Installation} for
installation-related bugs.

Build Nim from the released tarball at
\url{https://nim-lang.org/install_unix.html} It is different from the
GitHub sources as it contains Nimble, C sources \& other tools.

The Debian package ships bash and ksh completion and manpages that can
be reused.

Hints on the build process:

\begin{verbatim}
# build from C sources and then using koch
./build.sh --os $os_type --cpu $cpu_arch
./bin/nim c koch
./koch boot -d:release

# optionally generate docs into doc/html
./koch docs

./koch tools -d:release

# extract files to be really installed
./install.sh <tempdir>

# also include the tools
for fn in nimble nimsuggest nimgrep; do cp ./bin/$fn <tempdir>/nim/bin/; done
\end{verbatim}

What to install:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The expected stdlib location is /usr/lib/nim
\item
  Global configuration files under /etc/nim
\item
  Optionally: manpages, documentation, shell completion
\item
  When installing documentation, .idx files are not required
\item
  The "compiler" directory contains compiler sources and should not be
  part of the compiler binary package
\end{itemize}
